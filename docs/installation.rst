Installation
============

Currently, PyORCA has to be cloned from Git repository:

.. code-block::

    git clone https://github.com/oboril/pyorca.git

To be able to import the PyORCA module from any directory, you can add the ``src`` folder to your ``PYTHONPATH``.

PyPI distribution should be coming soon with first stable release!
