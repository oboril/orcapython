Parse input (file name and content)
Parse final output (exited normally / with error, runtime)

Look for major headers (one header should not contain another within itself in the output file):
    Geometry Optimization Run
    Single Point Calculation
    Nudged Elastic Band Calculation
    Relaxed Surface Scan
    
The input file is split by major headers and they are processed independently
